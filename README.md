The goal of this feature was to find a way to draw users to the wishlist page at careerfairy.io.

You are able to:
 - create wishes
 - Upload company logos
 - Upvote wishes
 - Post comments on wishes
 - search for wishes
 - Sort wishes by different categories


I tackled this issue by turning the page into a forum allowing user to create wishes for companies and have other users upvote and discuss about why they would like that company there.

This in turn provides a lot more feedback to the careerfairy team instead of just having numbers to go with. It also helps form a sort of forum community where people can revisit and exchange ideas based on these companies.

Installation:

1. Clone repo
2. navigate to package.json file and run (npm i)
3. run (npm start) and you'll be taken directly to the wishlist page.
